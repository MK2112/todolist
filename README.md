# todolist

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MK2112/todolist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MK2112/todolist)

## What's this?

This Kotlin app and its development are intended for me to gain some insight and experience. I just want to write something in Kotlin that I can actively use afterwards.
And I want to learn about structuring and software design. Basically the whole thing.

Some features I really need from this will be:
- [ ] Simple CLI
- [ ] Managing multiple TodoLists in one App
- [ ] Auto-Mail if set time for Todo-Task approached
- [ ] Managing different grades received @ school by date, class, teacher, topic, category
- [ ] Generate automated Todo-Items if important school assignments are about to happen
